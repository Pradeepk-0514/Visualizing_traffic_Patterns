*Abstract*
This project visualizes traffic patterns using real-time and historical data, revealing insights into flow, congestion,
peak times, and seasonal trends. Through interactive maps, heatmaps, and time-series charts, users can explore and analyze
traffic dynamics, aiding data-driven decisions for urban planning, congestion management, and infrastructure optimization.

# Visualizing_traffic_Patterns
Interactive Maps: Explore traffic data on a map with overlays indicating traffic density, flow speed, and areas of congestion.
Time Series Analysis: Visualize traffic patterns over time to identify peak hours and trends.
Heatmaps: View high-density areas and congestion points with color-coded heatmaps.
Filtering and Customization: Customize views by time, location, and other factors to get detailed insights.
Comparative Analysis: Compare traffic patterns across different times, dates, or locations.
